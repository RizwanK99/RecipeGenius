Recipe Genius is an Android application that allows users to generate custom meal plans based on their preferences. Users can select from a variety of dietary restrictions, cuisines, and ingredients to generate a meal plan that fits their needs. Users can also integrate their meal plans with their calendar and Instacart account to make the meal planning process even easier. The application will first present the user with a questionaire to determine their preferences. The user will then be able to view their meal plan and make changes to it.
